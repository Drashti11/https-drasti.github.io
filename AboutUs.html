	<strong type="size:50px">Finding a reliable worker has become a very important task of urban population. Especially, when the women of the family are working it is very difficult to handle the house perfectly. In this busy schedule, they have to go to outside to find the worker; still at the end they donâ€™t get the worker.<br><br>
	Another problem is there are so many workers (maids) who deadly want to do job but they are less educated or mostly uneducated. They are also suffering to get the job.<br><br>
	So thinking about these problems, this website is proposed. By this platform we can help in creating a good ecosystem of inclusive economic growth for the unorganized workers.<br><br>
	This website will connect the customers and the workers in an organized way at a local level, which allows both men and women workers to connect directly with the nearby work opportunities.<br><br>
